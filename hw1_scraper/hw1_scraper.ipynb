While many people might view working with data (including scraping, parsing, storing, etc.) a necessary evil to get to the \"fun\" stuff (i.e. modeling), we think that if presented in the right way this munging can be quite empowering. Imagine you never had to worry or ask those _what if_ questions about data existing or being accessible... but that you can get it yourself!\n",

    "* Custom Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NYT example, since it is a publicly visible page we did not need to authenticate. HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites. I'm sure you have seen [this](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QnUZW.png) before somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many REST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar concept common used by many APIs is to assign API Keys to each client that needs access to server resources. The client must then pass the API Key along with _every_ request it makes to the API to authenticate. This is because the server is typically relatively stateless and does not maintain a session between subsequent calls from the same client. Most APIs (including Yelp) allow you to pass the API Key via a special HTTP Header: `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`. Check out the [docs](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication) for more information.\n",
    "\n",

    "Return reviews in the order that they are present on the page.  There can be issues with Beautiful Soup using various parsers, for maximum conpatibility (and fewest errors) initialize the library with the default (and Python standard library parser): `BeautifulSoup(markup, \"html.parser\")`. You may notice that the HTML is automatically generated. Yelp uses a modern web application technology called [React](https://reactjs.org/), which generates the markup from Javascript code. This is a common hazard of scraping data from HTML, because the resulting code is not actually that readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints:\n",
    "1. As a general strategy, you should try using the Chrome browser (others probably have similar features), and the \"View -> Developer -> Inspect Elements\" command.  This lets you mouse over individual elements in the text and find the corresponding html entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the `.find()` and `.find_all()` commands in BeautifulSoup liberally.  In addition to finding exact tags, e.g. `element.find(\"tag\")` you can specify search terms in addition, including with regular exprssions.  For example, to find all sub-elements that have  `class = \" raw__<something>\"` you can use `element.find(\"tag\", class_=re.compile(r\"raw\"))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can also search the element with a regular expression using `element.find(\"tag\", string=re.compile(r\"<regex>\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can get the text content of a tag, converted to text (and preserving newlines), using `element.get_text(\"\\n\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Static downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have learned through extensive experience that requiring a class to parse live content pages over a 2 week assignment nearly _always_ will lead to a situation where people add and delete reviews during the assignment period, causing the grader tests to go out of date.  There are also sometimes issues in actually getting the HTML properly from headless nodes like the ones that run on Colab.  Thus, while you would normally, as the first line in your function, issue a command like the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "html = retrieve_html(url)[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "we are also providing a `parse_yelp_page_dict` dictionary along with the assigment that has all the necessary pages (correct as of the assignment release).  So instead of the line above you could call:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "html = parse_yelp_page_dict[url]\n",
    "```\n",
    "These are literally just downloads of the Yelp page HTML as of the time the assignment is released.  While it will be nice to test your function using the real Yelp page, to see it working in action, you probably should do your final testing and submission using these pre-downloaded files.  But note that regardless of whether you use these saved files or the live web version, you will definitely need to use a web browser on the real system to inspect the elements of the live page.  Attempting to manually parse the HTML as it's is downloaded to these files would be extremely difficult."
